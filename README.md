  2. For Analysis
  3. For data Visualisation

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
in the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions;
   1. Data loading and inspection

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic EXCEL functions used during my analysis;
